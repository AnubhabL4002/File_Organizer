  Hello! Are you facing problems organizing your files again and again manually?<br>
  Don't worry! I created a file organizer for you using Python.<br>
  <hr class="solid">
  <ul>
    <li>It will detect all types of files you have unorganized.</li>
    <li>It will create folders for each of the types.</li>
    <li>It will then push all the files to the folders according to their types.</li>
    <li>All your organized files are now organized in one run!</li>
  </ul>
